def gaussian_pmax_ci(x_probed, connected, sigma, alpha=0.05):

    profile that most closely fits data from a connectivity experiment.

    This function models connectivity as a gaussian curve with respect to intersomatic 
    distance; two cells are less likely to be connected if the distance between them is
    large. In an ideal scenario we would use a maximum likelihood estimation to determine
    the gaussian amplitude and sigma that most closely match the data. In practice,
    however, very large N is required to constrain sigma so we instead use a fixed sigma
    and focus on estimating the amplitude. 

    Another practical constraint is that exact estimates and confidence intervals are 
    expensive to compute, so we use a close approximation that simply scales the 
    connectivity proportion and binomial confidence intervals using the average connection
    probability from the gaussian profile. 

    For more detail on how this method was chosen and developed, see
    aisynphys/doc/connectivity_vs_distance.ipynb.

    Parameters

    sigma : float
        Gaussian Ïƒ value defining the width of the connectivity profile to fit to *x_probed* and *connected*.
    alpha : float
        Alpha value setting the width of the confidence interval. Default is 0.05, giving a 95% CI.

    -------
    pmax : float
