Introduction
============

Welcome to the Synaptic Physiology code repository. Here you will find information for :ref:`installing <installation>` a conda environment with our repository (and supporting ones) so that you can explore and analyze the Synaptic Physiology Dataset for yourself. We've included tools and information that audiences with different levels of programming expertise. Look to the :ref:`Interactive Tools <interactive_tools>` for graphical interfaces that will help you nagivate and explore the data, but with limited custom analysis. For those who want to dig into the data deeper and are familiar with database queries, see our :ref:`API Reference <api_reference>` on how best to get started.

We hope to engage with the community who are interested in our data and tools. You can interact with us, and the larger Allen Institute community, via the `Allen Brain Map Community Forum <https://community.brain-map.org/>`_. Search for, or tag your post with `synaptic-physiology`. You can also `email <synapticphysiology@alleninstitute.org>`_ us directly to stay up to date on new data and tools as they become available or to ask us a question.
