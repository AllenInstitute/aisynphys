In this section we highlight the components of the `aisynphys` API that are used to access data from the `Synaptic Physiology dataset <https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/connectivity/synaptic-physiology>`_. Two sources of data are available for download: (1) relational databases that summarize the experiments that were performed and their analysis results, and (2) the original data recorded in the form of HDF5 files (NWB v1). For most use cases, the relational database files are the recommended way to access the dataset.
